This is a tic-tac-toe single page application that can actually hold
users information and tell you exactly how many games that you have
played. For this application, I wanted something that was simple, yet
had a lot of character and didnt necessarily look like it was easy to
make. I think one of the main features that I wanted my application to
visually have was simply a big gameboard so that the user could easily
see and interact with the gameboard without hesitation. I also wanted to
have an instruction area on my website that explained the game but also
was enough in the background that it did not detract from the actual gameboard
and interacting with the game.
I knew that it would be a good idea to be able to store users information into
an online Api, and be able to communicate with this api. I wanted the buttons
on these peices of my application to really stand out, I wanted them to be a
deep dark purpled to really stick out from that black background. I also wanted
the application to communicate with the user whenever there was either a win
or if there was a tie that ensued. I wanted a play again button at the bottom of
the web page that basically reset the gameboard to an empty board.
